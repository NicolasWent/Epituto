# Description of folder "unclassed"

This folder is created so you can add here your tutorial when no folder for it
exist.

For example if you are writting a tutorial on how to install a plugin vim but the
folder "config/vim/plugins" does not exist, you can put your tutorial here and
the moderators or someone else will put your tutorial on the right place.

This folder is not required for the people who contribute from command line
(this tutorial: [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/NicolasWent/Epituto/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)) as you can create your own folders.
