# Description of folder "unclassed"

This folder is created for those who didn't find the right folder for their tutorial, so they can add it here.

For example if you are writting a tutorial on "how to install a plugin Vim" but the
folder "config/vim/plugins" does not exist, you can put your tutorial here and
the moderators or someone else will put your tutorial on the right place (creating the folders and so on).

This folder is not required for people who contribute from command line
(this tutorial: [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/NicolasWent/Epituto/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)) as you can create your own folders using command line.
